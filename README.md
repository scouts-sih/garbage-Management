# ♻️ Waste Classification and Disposal Guidance App

This project provides a comprehensive solution for waste classification and disposal guidance. It leverages image recognition (via Roboflow) and a Large Language Model (via Groq) to help users identify waste items and learn how to properly dispose of them. The application aims to promote responsible waste management by providing clear, concise, and actionable disposal instructions. It also incorporates gamification elements to encourage user engagement and make learning about waste disposal fun.

🚀 **Key Features**

*   **Image-Based Waste Classification:** Uses Roboflow API to classify waste items from images.
*   **Detailed Disposal Guidance:** Provides specific disposal instructions and tips for each waste category.
*   **LLM-Powered Advice:** Integrates with Groq API for more detailed and personalized disposal advice.
*   **Gamification:** Includes points, levels, and other game mechanics to encourage user engagement.
*   **Configuration Management:** Centralized configuration for API keys, model identifiers, and other settings.
*   **Waste Category Definition:** Structured representation of different waste types with icons and colors.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** (Implied) Designed for easy navigation and intuitive use.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

*   **Frontend:** (Likely) JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS (based on implied UI integration)
*   **Backend:** (Potentially) Node.js, Express.js (if a server-side component exists)
*   **AI/ML:**
    *   Roboflow API (Image Recognition)
    *   Groq API (Large Language Model)
*   **Data Storage:** (Potentially) JSON (for configuration and data), Database (if user data is stored)
*   **Build Tools:** (Likely) npm, yarn, webpack, or similar
*   **Other:** Git, Markdown

📦 **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
*   Roboflow account and API key.
*   Groq account and API key.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  Configure API keys:

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    *   Add your Roboflow and Groq API keys to the `.env` file:

        ```
        ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=<your_roboflow_api_key>
        GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
        ```

        (Replace `<your_roboflow_api_key>` and `<your_groq_api_key>` with your actual API keys.)

### Running Locally

1.  Start the application:

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    (Refer to the project's `package.json` file for the exact start command.)

💻 **Usage**

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  Upload an image of a waste item.
3.  The application will classify the waste item using the Roboflow API.
4.  The application will display disposal instructions and tips for the classified waste item, potentially enhanced by the Groq API.
5.  Earn points and level up by correctly classifying waste items!
